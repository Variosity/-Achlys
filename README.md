ACHLYS - THE OUROBOROS AWAKENS


> **"Achlys is the first programming language designed specifically for security professionals."**
>
> **Built-in capabilities:**
> - Network sockets for exploit development
> - GUI framework for tool creation
> - Self-compiling to standalone binaries
>
> **Unique features:**
> - Learn Latin while coding (classical education meets technology)
> - Zero dependencies (2MB binary runs anywhere)
> - Ouroboros compilation (language compiles itself)
>
> **Perfect for:**
> - Penetration testers building custom tools
> - Security researchers prototyping exploits
> - Students learning both programming and Latin
> - Indie game devs wanting native speed + easy graphics
>
>  *From code to executable in one command.*
>  *No runtime. No dependencies. Just results.*
>
>  *Achlys: The Void awaits your command.*

<Write code in Achlys>
<Compile to standalone binary IN Achlys>
<Binary includes interpreter + code>
<ONE file distribution>
<No runtime, no VM, no dependencies>

---


Write code in Achlys → Compile with Achlys → Get standalone binary


ouroboros.nox (written in Achlys)
    ↓
Reads target .nox code
    ↓
Embeds it into ACHLYS.c using C raw strings
    ↓
Compiles standalone binary with GCC
    ↓
Binary contains: Interpreter + Your Code
    ↓
Distribution: Single executable, no external files needed

``


FEATURES:


<Compiles to native code>
<Has built-in sockets>
<Creates GUI tools>
<Distributes as single binary>
<Uses elegant Latin syntax>
          +
<All in ONE package>


SPECS:


// Direct memory access (via C interop)
// Networking built-in
// Graphics built-in
// System calls built-in
// Compiles to native code
// No garbage collection overhead
// Full control


BUILT IN:


*Self-hosting compiler (ouroboros.nox)*
*Networking (sockets)*
*Graphics (Raylib)*
*File I/O*
*Full language (functions, objects, arrays, recursion)*




BUILD:


- Port scanners
- Exploit frameworks
- Network sniffers
- Packet crafters
- HTTP servers
- GUI security tools
- 2D/3D games
- Visualization tools
- System utilities
- ANYTHING


WITH:

*Security-First Design*

Other languages add security tools later
Achlys has them built-in from day one


*Zero-Dependency Distribution*

The Ouroboros compilation model is UNIQUE
No other interpreted language does this


**Cross-Domain Mastery**

*Network tools*
*Graphics/games*
*System programming*
**All in ONE language**

WHO ACHLYS IS FOR:


- Hackers/Security Professionals - Built-in tools
- Students - Learn Latin + Programming
- Indie Game Devs - Easy graphics + native speed
- System Programmers - Simpler than C/Rust
- Educators - Classical languages meet tech

THIS ISN'T JUST A LANGUAGE, IT'S A..


* A security professional's toolkit
* An educational platform
* A game engine
* An OS foundation
* A cultural bridge (Latin + Tech)
* A new paradigm (Ouroboros compilation)



Now execute. Build. Ship. Dominate.
From the Void, we forge power.
In darkness, we find clarity.
⚔️ ACHLYS AWAITS YOUR COMMAND.
